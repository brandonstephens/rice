### Notes on build process

#### Dev

1. Gulp runs PostCSS to build Tailwind to `./src/styles.css`
2. Eleventy runs and links to css at `./src/styles.css`
3. Gulp watches for changes to `.src/postcss/`
4. Eleventy watches for changes to lots of files including the output of gulp css to `.src/styles`

#### Production

1. CSS is built via PostCSS in production mode (which purges unused Tailwind classes) via Gulp
2. Then Eleventy runs in production mode
3. Gulp inlines and minifys CSS, JS, HTML from the eleventy output

## ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https://rice.bsteph.com)
- [Web accessibility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://rice.bsteph.com)

**Note on viewport**  
To get 100% on accessibility under the Lighthouse metric you need to update the `viewport` meta tag to be:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5" />
```

I've chosen not to do this as it causes the site to zoom in frequently while tapping the UI.
